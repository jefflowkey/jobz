This is a site that I built while I was testing mySQL online hosting.
It is a login system with sessions. 
A user is able to sign up, sign in, sign out, reset password and once logged in, a welcome page is displayed.
The password is encrypted and stored in the database as well as the username.

You can test this using the below link:
